# Morti

Open-source parametric furniture design for cabinets, shelves, wardrobes, and other panel-based pieces. Morti is local-first: projects are edited in the browser with Yjs and IndexedDB, then can optionally sync to a Postgres-backed cloud service for publishing, sharing, and remixing.

## Environment

Copy the example file when running without Docker:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Important variables:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Yes | Public app URL. Use `http://localhost:3000` for local dev and `https://your-domain.example` in production. |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL` | Production recommended | Public mirror of `APP_BASE_URL`; Compose files set this automatically. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | At least 32 characters. Used for sessions, OTP hashes, and rate-limit hashes. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Postgres connection string. Add `?sslmode=require` or set `PGSSLMODE=require` if your provider requires SSL. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Docker prod | Used by `docker-compose.prod.yml` for the bundled Postgres service. |
| `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` | Production auth | Required for OTP email unless you only use local dev bypass. |
| `POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL` | Production auth | Must be a verified sender/domain in Postmark. |
| `POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM` | No | Defaults to `outbound`. |
| `LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS` | Dev only | Set `true` only for Nuxt dev mode on localhost. Ignored in production builds. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Optional | Required only when AI furniture generation is enabled. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN` | Optional | Required only when AI furniture generation is enabled. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_AI_MODEL` | Optional | Defaults to `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`. |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_FEATURES_PROMPT_FURNITURE` | Optional | Set `true` to show the prompt-based furniture UI. |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` | Optional | Leave blank to disable PostHog. |
| `NUXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_SCRIPT_SRC` | Optional | Custom analytics script URL. Leave blank to disable. |

The server creates and updates its Postgres schema on startup, so there is currently no separate migration command.

## Local Development

Start Postgres however you prefer, then install dependencies and run Nuxt:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

For a no-email local workflow, set these in `.env`:

```env
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET=morti-local-development-secret-change-me-32-chars
DATABASE_URL=postgres://morti:morti_dev_password@localhost:5432/morti
LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=true
```

`LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=true` only works in Nuxt dev mode on localhost. It provisions a local admin user so contributors can exercise projects, publishing, and demo administration without Postmark while developing.

## Local Docker

The default Compose file runs a Nuxt dev server plus Postgres with local auth bypass enabled:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If your Docker install still uses the legacy Compose binary, replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose`.

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Data is stored in Docker volumes named `morti_dev_postgres_data` and `morti_dev_node_modules`.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose logs -f app
docker compose down
docker compose down -v
```

Use `docker compose down -v` only when you want to delete the local Docker database volume.

## Production Docker

`docker-compose.prod.yml` builds the Nuxt production image and runs it behind a local-only port binding at `127.0.0.1:3000`. Put Caddy, Nginx, Traefik, or another reverse proxy in front of it for HTTPS.

On the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/morti.git
cd morti
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` for production:

```env
APP_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.example
AUTH_SECRET=generate-a-long-random-secret-at-least-32-chars
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=generate-a-long-random-postgres-password
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN=your-postmark-token
POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL=auth@your-domain.example
POSTMARK_MESSAGE_STREAM=outbound
NUXT_PUBLIC_FEATURES_PROMPT_FURNITURE=false
LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=false
AI_FURNITURE_ALLOW_LOCAL_UNAUTH=false
```

Generate secrets with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Start the production stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f app
```

Example Nginx location:

```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

## DigitalOcean Deployment

Referral link: https://m.do.co/c/228d4bc321e8

The simplest DigitalOcean path is a Docker Droplet:

1. Create a Droplet with Docker preinstalled or install Docker on Ubuntu.
2. Point your DNS record at the Droplet.
3. Clone this repository on the Droplet.
4. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set production values.
5. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`.
6. Put a reverse proxy with TLS in front of `127.0.0.1:3000`.

For DigitalOcean App Platform:

1. Create an App Platform app from this repository or from a container image.
2. Use the included `Dockerfile`.
3. Set the service HTTP port to `3000`.
4. Add a managed Postgres database and expose its connection string as `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Add `AUTH_SECRET`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `NUXT_PUBLIC_APP_BASE_URL`, Postmark variables, and any optional Cloudflare or analytics variables.
6. Redeploy after changing environment variables.

If you use a managed Postgres database that requires SSL, set `PGSSLMODE=require` or include `sslmode=require` in `DATABASE_URL`.

## AI Furniture Generation

The AI endpoint is disabled from the UI unless:

```env
NUXT_PUBLIC_FEATURES_PROMPT_FURNITURE=true
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
CLOUDFLARE_AI_API_TOKEN=...
```

Authenticated and verified users are rate limited per user, IP, and platform day. In dev mode only, `AI_FURNITURE_ALLOW_LOCAL_UNAUTH=true` allows local unauthenticated testing.

## Demo Import Script

The legacy demo import script is intentionally unconfigured by default:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://... \
POCKETBASE_DEMOS_URL='https://example.com/api/collections/projects/records?perPage=100' \
node scripts/import-pocketbase-demos.mjs
```

Set `DEMO_OWNER_ID` and `DEMO_OWNER_EMAIL` if you need a specific demo owner row.

## Development Checks

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=critical
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm --prefix .output/server install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
npm --prefix .output/server audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

The first audit covers the complete source and build dependency tree. The second audits the exact Nitro server artifact that is deployed, while avoiding false release blocks from currently unpatched Nuxt development-tool advisories. The same release gate runs in GitHub Actions. See `docs/release-0.1.md` for the 0.1 manual product checklist and release steps.

## Data Notes

- Browser projects are stored locally in IndexedDB and can be exported as `.morti` files.
- The IndexedDB database name is still `madera` for backwards compatibility with older local projects.
- Cloud snapshots are stored in Postgres as binary Yjs updates.
- Published project routes only serve records with `visibility = public`, a non-deleted row, and a snapshot.

## Manufacturing Status

Cutlist, machining operations, and generated measurements are preview features in 0.1. Independently verify dimensions, joinery, edge treatment, hardware, tolerances, and material constraints before ordering panels or manufacturing furniture.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env`, `.secrets/`, deployment keys, or generated build output.
- Rotate any secret that was ever pushed to a public repository.
- Use HTTPS in production so `morti_session` cookies are sent securely.
- Keep `LOCAL_AUTH_BYPASS=false` and `AI_FURNITURE_ALLOW_LOCAL_UNAUTH=false` in production.
